TESTING EXAMPLE

python -c 'import script; script.sparse_search(["A", "", "", "", "B", "", "", "", "C"], "B")'

python -c 'import script; script.sparse_search(["A", "", "", "", ""], "A")'


In order to test a product, many companies use empty or “fake” data. Our company, Searchcademy, uses empty sparsely sorted data to test its awesome search engine. What exactly does that mean?

In this project, we will implement a modified version of iterative binary search to search through a sparsely sorted dataset.
